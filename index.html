                <h2>Big personality in a tiny package</h2>
                   <p>The <b>Schnauzer</b> is a breed who’s got it 
                   all in one small package: intelligence, affection, an extroverted temperament,<br>
                   humor, and a personality that’s twice as big as he is. Throw in that walrus moustache and quivering<br> enthusiasm, and he’ll make
                   you laugh every day. With a Miniature Schnauzer in the house, you’ll never<br> be alone, not even when you go to the bathroom. He’s 
                   got personality-plus, and whether he’s bounding<br> around ahead of you or curled up snoozing on your lap, you’ll never be bored with
                   him around.

                <h2>The look</h2>
                     <p>He's got a long beard and bushy eyebrows, and he's a handful. Developed as a ratter, he may look just like a smaller version of the Standard and Giant Schnauzers, but he's a distinct breed of his own. He isn't used much as a ratter any longer (although the instinct is still there), but he still has the lively, mischievous personality.

            <h3>Center Of Attention</h3>  
            <p>  He likes to be in the center of the action. He's fairly good with children and he's energetic, with a lot of terrier spunkiness. The problem is, he has no clue how small he is, and he's likely to talk trash to a much larger dog without any concept of the consequences. That swagger of his can get him in trouble, so it's up to you to keep him in line.
